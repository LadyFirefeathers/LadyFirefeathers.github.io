			<h5>Project 1: Doughnut Delight</h5>
			<h5>Timeframe: one hour</h5>
			<h5>Team: Two UX-ers and a friend</h5>
			<h5>Challenge: Create a responsive website for a doughnut company that has a food truck and also will deliver custom made doughnuts to your office</h5>

			<ol>
				<li>First we established that the site would have the goal of delighting board office workers who are looking for a tasty treat to brighton their day.
				</li>	
				

				<li>On the home page we placed a map that would always show where the truck would be parked and if it was open for business. Then we added a page containing the feed from a live web cam in the kitchen of the bakery. Finally we gave the user the ability to visually create their own custom doughnut and order a dozen to be delivered to their office. 
				</li>



				<li>As we talked, a low-fidelity wireframe for both mobile and web was sketched out on the table. (General Assembly is furnished with tables especially made to use dry-erase markers so no tables were damaged in the making of these wireframes.)

			<h5>Project 2: Updated UX for Intrepid Travel</h5>
			<h5>Timeframe: Two weeks</h5>
			<h5>Team: Three UX-ers</h5>
			<h5>Challenge: How do you take a site with hundreds of prepackaged trips and make it pleasant to use by age 50+ people of the western world?</h5>

			<ol>
				<li>Partnering with two of my classmates, Katie and Emerson, we first tackled this project by interviewing the age 50+ people in our networks about their travel habits. We created an infinity diagram and concluded that Trust is the key to this demographic. Generally speaking we found that the 50+ demographic is adventurous in travel but they don’t trust the internet as a whole. 
				</li>	


				<li>I contributed to the project by focusing on creating trust though a visually simple and easy to use interface on the home page. I started designing with in the size confines of mobile and thinking as we age our motor-skills become less preses and hence I wanted big, definitive buttons. Also, our eyesight starts to become compromised so I thought about large text as well. Low fidelity wireframes were ideated.
				</li>



				<li>Next I expanded the block idea to tablet and desktop. I bumped into the fact that with seven continents there is always an empty space. At first my group filled this with a list of themed trips however when we tested our first prototype, this confused people since themes weren’t a continent or a place to go. In the next ideation we used proximity to solve the confusion:

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My professional story starts in 1999 when I graduated from a two-year intensive design school with a degree in Graphic Design. Over the years and through a minor and major recession I received my bachelor of Arts and found my niche in long document layout (catalogs, magazines, and reports). I was introduced to User Experience as a field in December 2014 and fell head over heals in love. Looking into how to give this new love a direction and foundation I decide to attend General Assemble's User Experience Immersion. Now I'm trekking on, finding my passion growing with every UX project and peer I meet.</p>

		<p>The project featured above in the "my process" section are ones I acomplished during my ten-week immersive class at General Assembly. Here are general descriptions of several other projects I worked on: </p>

		<h4>General Assembly User Experience Immersion | April-June 2015</h4>

		<blockquote><strong>E-commerce Site Design Project-</strong> Created an e-commerce site for a school uniform company. Identified through user research that customers wanted a master list of clothing requirements. Devised a path for users to enter the name of a school and have the requirements list follow them through out their shopping experience. Demonstrated solution through a medium fidelity clickable prototype.</blockquote>

		<blockquote><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-glyphicon glyphicon-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></span><strong>Site Improvement Project-</strong> A travel company wanted to step into the 50+ age market. Working with a group of three UX-ers, researched this age bracket, then streamlined both general search functionality and comparison feature. Tested site using medium fidelity prototype, then created hi fidelity wireframs to present.</blockquote>

		<blockquote><strong>List App Creation Project-</strong> Together with two classmates and three developers, designed the concept for a movie listing app that focused on giving a rewarding feeling to the user. Created persona, and scenario, then low-fidelity wireframes keeping developer ability and time in mind. Presented a high fidelity prototype to class and faculty.</blockquote>

		<h4>Examples of my Work Experience</h4>
		<p> I've worked as a graphic designer and production artist in the print field since 2000. Here are three example of how I used my UX intuition and empathy durring those years:

			<blockquote>
				<h5>smartdept. inc. (Smith Design) | November 2014</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>A higher education client needed a comprehensive proposal designed and laid out that focused on its history, community involvement, and future investments in order to persuade a foreign government to allow them to build a satellite campus</li>

					<li>Persona Development- zeroed in on the reader being a knowledgeable businessman looking for detailed and in-depth information stated in a formal business tone with precision and clarity </li>

					<li>Information Architecture- created the structure and hierarchy of information including positioning for section headers, footers, and tables </li>

					<li>Visual Design- chose font hierarchy, color scheme, and created tables</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>

			<blockquote>
				<h5>smartdept. inc. (Herff Jones | Nystrome) | April 2013- July 2014</h5>
				<p>The marketing department requested an advertisement designed 
					for the printed program of an educational conference that would drive traffic 
					to their booth.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>User Reasearch- interviewed a marketing staff member who has manned the company’s conference booths, compile a list of five common goals of attendees </li>

						<li>Copy Writing- Devised questions from the five goals established from marketing staff interview to use as advertisement copy and created a call to action encouraging attendees to acquire the answers at the company’s booth</li>
						<li>Visual Design- laid out a full page ad using corporate guidelines</li>
					</ul>
				</blockquote>

				<blockquote>
					<h5>Office Party, The Board Game | August-November 2011</h5>
					<p>Two women who had conceived a board game needed a prototype developed for play testing, display, and demonstration at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair. </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Prototyping- Using Adobe Illustrator, designed layout for board, spinner, cards, and pieces; sourced player pawns and hands for spinner; printed and assembled all parts</li>

						<li>Visual Design- Chose color scheme for visual cues and illustrated pieces</li>

						<li>User Testing- play tested game with friends age 28 to 35; interviewed each person, asking questions regarding clarity of written rules, game mechanics, level of complexity, and over all enjoyment</li>

						<li>Results- Client received an invaluable amount of feed back from game experts and was offered a further interview from an investor</li>

					</ul>
