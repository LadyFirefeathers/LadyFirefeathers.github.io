				<h2>Phoenix's recipe for the UX process</h2>
				<p>I love to bake so I equate the parts of the UX process with how the ingredients in a recipe work together to make a delicious cake:</p>
				<p>The dry ingredients form the base- The brief for a project gives you the place to start. I make a bullet pointed list of what is known, create a task timeline, list questions for the client to clarify, and list questions that need researched.</p>
				<h2>BIND</h2>
				<p>Eggs bind all the ingredients together- just like research binds a UX project. I choose the appropriate research methods and implement them, then analyze the data, then use the data to create personas, user stories and journeys.</p>
				<h2>BLEND</h2>
				<p>Oil blends all the flavors- I ideate using all of the knowledge and facts I have from the brief and research. Starting with pen and paper, I come up with possible solutions en mass, then collaborate with teammates and decide on a direction.</p>
				<h2>BUILD</h2>
				<p>Milk builds the flavors- I use software to build wireframes and prototypes that give a clear visual picture.</p>
				<h2>BAKE</h2>
				<p>The oven adds the energy to bake the cake- I add more energy by iterating to improve on my original solution, using research and testing data as a foundation.<p/>
					<h2>DELIVER</h2>
					<p>Eat the cake- I present my solutions to the client.</p>
					<h4>Repeat as necessary.</h4>

					<p>Below you'll find three out of the six projects I worked on during my 10 weeks at General Assembly. Each week we built upon what we learned the previous. We touched on many research methods including surveys, face-to-face interviews, observation, and card sorting. Also we were given liberty to try different wireframing software. Over the six projects, I used Draw.io, Axure, Balsamiq, and my trusty favorite- Adobe InDesign.</p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>My professional story starts in 1999 when I graduated from a two-year intensive design school with a degree in Graphic Design. Over the years and through a minor and major recession I received my bachelor of Arts and found my niche in long document layout (catalogs, magazines, and reports). I was introduced to User Experience as a field in December 2014 and fell head over heals in love. Looking into how to give this new love a direction and foundation I decide to attend General Assemble's User Experience Immersion. Now I'm trekking on, finding my passion growing with every UX project and peer I meet.</p>

				<h4>Examples of my past work experience</h4>
				<p> I've worked as a graphic designer and production artist in the print field since 2000. Here are three example of how I used my UX intuition and empathy during those years:

					<blockquote>
						<h5>smartdept. inc. (Smith Design) | November 2014</h5>
						<ul>
							<li>A higher education client needed a comprehensive proposal designed and laid out that focused on its history, community involvement, and future investments in order to persuade a foreign government to allow them to build a satellite campus</li>

							<li>Persona Development- zeroed in on the reader being a knowledgeable businessman looking for detailed and in-depth information stated in a formal business tone with precision and clarity </li>

							<li>Information Architecture- created the structure and hierarchy of information including positioning for section headers, footers, and tables </li>

							<li>Visual Design- chose font hierarchy, color scheme, and created tables</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<h5>smartdept. inc. (Herff Jones | Nystrome) | April 2013- July 2014</h5>
						<p>The marketing department requested an advertisement designed for the printed program of an educational conference that would drive traffic to their booth.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>User Reasearch- interviewed a marketing staff member who has manned the company’s conference booths, compile a list of five common goals of attendees </li>

							<li>Copy Writing- Devised questions from the five goals established from marketing staff interview to use as advertisement copy and created a call to action encouraging attendees to acquire the answers at the company’s booth</li>
							<li>Visual Design- laid out a full page ad using corporate guidelines</li>
						</ul>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<h5>Office Party, The Board Game | August-November 2011</h5>
						<p>Two women who had conceived a board game needed a prototype developed for play testing, display, and demonstration at the Chicago Toy and Game Fair. </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Prototyping- Using Adobe Illustrator, designed layout for board, spinner, cards, and pieces; sourced player pawns and hands for spinner; printed and assembled all parts</li>

							<li>Visual Design- Chose color scheme for visual cues and illustrated pieces</li>

							<li>User Testing- play tested game with friends age 28 to 35; interviewed each person, asking questions regarding clarity of written rules, game mechanics, level of complexity, and over all enjoyment</li>

							<li>Results- Client received an invaluable amount of feed back from game experts and was offered a further interview from an investor</li>

						</ul>
					</blockquote>
