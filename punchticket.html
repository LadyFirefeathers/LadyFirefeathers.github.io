		<h3>Team</h3>

		<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phoenixheller">Phoenix Heller</a></p>
		<p>Three developers from the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program</p>
		<em>General Assembly gave us the opportunity to participate in a cross immersive project between my User Experience Design Immersion (UXDI) class and the Web Development Immersive (WDI) class to give both classes the benefit of experiencing working on a team with each other.</em>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>TicketPunch is an app that lists movies. The brief stated that they wanted an app with the design focused around rewarding the user. </p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>In six hours, create a medium fidelity wireframe app and a readme file that gives users the ability to search for movies and add them to a list.</p>

<h3>Quick UX</h3>
<p>In order to focus our efforts on a particular user we invented Bob as our persona. He is a high school history teacher who comes home from work tired and still has to correct papers. He likes to put on a movie in the back ground wile he does this. He hates having to think of more then what frozen meal he is going to have for dinner.
Both the Devs and the UX-ers collaborated to come up with a list of ways to reward Bob that aren't a prize. We also sketched out a MSCW chart and looked at a few apps that are on the iTunes store. </p>

<h3>Rewarding Ideas in Columns</h3>

<p>Seeing how many movies you've watched along with the ability to move a movie from one column to the other became our reward. We collaborated on a basic layout, Devs giving feedback on what they could accomplish in our timeframe, and the UX-ers designing solutions.</p>

<h3>Visual Designs</h3>

<p>While the Devs worked on the Readme file, Linsey and I laid out two versions of the screen using the colors given in the brief. We set the tone with a minimalistic style and focused on comfort and concise as our catch word. Linsey and I then showed the two ideas to the three Devs and they voted on what parts of which to use.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Ticket punch uses a clean interface that allows the user to search for movies they want to watch, add then to a watch list, and then move them to a watched list. The user is rewarded by seeing the number of movies they have watched and by taking the action to move a movie from the watch to watched list.</p>
