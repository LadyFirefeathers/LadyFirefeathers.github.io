<h2>my experience</h2>

<p>My professional story starts in 1999 when I graduated from a two-year intensive design school with a degree in Graphic Design. Over the years and through a minor and major recession I received my bachelor of Arts and found my niche in long document layout (catalogs, magazines, and reports). I was introduced to User Experience as a field in December 2014 and fell head over heals in love. Looking into how to give this new love a direction and foundation I decide to attend General Assemble’s User Experience Immersion. Now I’m trekking on, finding my passion growing with every UX project and peer I meet.</p>
<p>The project featured under the "my process" tab was one I acomplished during my ten-week immersive class at General Assembly. Here are general descriptions of several other projects I worked on: </p>
<blocktext>Project one- Through interviewing a classmate, identified he wanted more options to make his 40-minute commute more productive. Ideated with full class of 14. Narrowed ideas to an unmanned kiosk located in CTA and Metra stations that would service both commuters with and without mobile devices.</blocktext>
<blocktext>Project two- Created an e-commerce site for a school uniform company. Identified through user research that customers wanted a master list of clothing requirements. Devised a path for users to enter the name of a school and have the requirements list follow them through out their shopping experience. Demonstrated solution through a medium fidelity prototype.</blocktext>
<blocktext>Project three- A travel company wanted to step into the 50+ age market. Working with a group of three, researched this age bracket, then streamlined both general search functionality and comparison feature. Tested site using medium fidelity prototype, then created hi fidelity wireframs to present.</blocktext>
<p>Though I'm relatively new to formal UX, I've been practicing it for years through my career as a print graphic designer</p>

<p> As much as I love my work and can talk about user experience all day, there is much more to me: I have a vast knowledge of cooking and baking gluten-free. I love hosting small gatherings and big parties much to my friends delight as the table is always covered with new goodies and treats. I’m one of those few people who actually uses their heirloom silver and china for formal dinner parties. Cooking up a four-course meal is a challenge I relish. And my friends covet.
Travel is a love, but I don’t have to cross the pond to fulfill my sense of adventure. Sauntering down a street I’ve never been on is sometimes an adventure in itself. My back yard is the city of Chicago so you never know what you’ll discover, be it an awesome hole-in-the-wall restaurant with mind-blowing noodles, an arts festival, or a breath taking view from the 50th floor.
For a pastime, I people-watch. I like to think of myself as an armchair anthropologist, studying human nature through every interaction. So far, it’s been an eye-opener. I also listens to history podcasts for amusement. This information does pay off, though. I often use my knowledge of culture, past and present, as inspiration.</p>
